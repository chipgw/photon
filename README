Building Photon:
  use cmake to generate build files.
  run make or open project file depending on the generator used.
NOTE: compiler must support C++11
NOTE: I use some GCC specific compiler flags, so it will probably take some modification to get it working with anything else... (I use gcc on linux and mingw-w64 on windows) 

libraries:
  Freetype2 (freetype.org)
  GLEW (glew.sourceforge.net)
  LibXML2 (xmlsoft.org/)
  OpenGL (2 or later)
  PhysFS (2 or later, icculus.org/physfs/)
  SDL2 (hg, libsdl.org)
  SOIL (lonesock.net/soil.html)
